# Yard Dog
An Android Application for users to find near by people to watch their dogs. 

### Description:
This application idea was pitched to the team over a weekend hackathon at CSU Monterey Bay for Ideas of March. The team developed and designed the application in 48 hours over the weekend. After presenting the application, the team won the crowd favorite award. No one in the team at the time had any Android developing experience, let alone Java exposure. It was a great learning and growing experience for everyone. 

### Developed by: 
Akuang Saechao, Joshua Kling, Evan Schwander, Aneirin Nunn, and Sonny Inopiquez
